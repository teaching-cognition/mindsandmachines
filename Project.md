# Final Project Details

Your final project will involve abstracting themes from the course material we cover each week and producing an original critique on one or a few aspects of intelligence. You have two options in terms of choosing the final project:

1. You can choose to review and sythesize the literature on one particular aspect of intelligence discussed in class (e.g., language, vision, babies, animals, etc.), and propose a novel study to follow-up on current work in the area.
2. You can pick an animal/species, an example of AI from pop culture or the real world and demonstrate how and why it is close to or far from artificial general intelligence using a framework we have discussed in class. 

For **either** option, you will need to:

1. Meet with me to discuss the general direction you want to pursue
2. Write a 10-page, double-spaced paper in Times New Roman font using APA style
3. Present a synopsis of your paper on the last day of class in the <a href="https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/" target="_blank">3-minute-thesis format</a>
