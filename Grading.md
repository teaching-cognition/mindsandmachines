# Grading

The grading scale for this class is as follows:

- A:	93-100% of total points
- A-:	90 to 92.99 
- B+:	87 to 89.99 
- B:	83 to 86.99
- B-:	80 to 82.99
- C+:	77 to 79.99
- C:	73 to 77.99
- C-:	70 to 72.99
- D:	60 to 69.99
- F:	fewer than 60%

All scores will be rounded to the nearest whole number. 

Grades will be determined based on the following rubric, which is based on emphasizing our three learning goals: 
1. Analyze and <span style="color:#508AB0">evaluate</span> current approaches to understanding and building intelligence
2.  <span style="color:#E7AC10">Synthesize</span> literature on a focused aspect of intelligence and produce an original critique
3. Develop an <span style="color:#1CB447">appreciation</span> for cultural and ethical issues surrounding the study of intelligence

## Hypothes.is annotations

For the research articles that you will read during the week, you are required to submit annotations and respond to your classmates' annotations by 9 AM on the day of class, using the Hypothes.is tool within Canvas. Annotations are visible to all classmates.

Your annotations should reflect your engagement with the material and you are encouraged to ask thoughtful questions as you go. You are required to post at least two annotations per reading, but feel free to post as many as you wish. The goal of these annotations is to stimulate the in-class discussions, so remember to be thoughtful and respectful of your classmates' ideas and opinions as you make and view annotations.

Making good-quality annotations requires you to critically engage with the readings. As you think through the content, consider the central arguments posed by the paper, and pose questions about the logic, clarity, technical soundness, as well as implications of the arguments. You may not have all the answers for the questions that come to mind and are not expected to, either. But you are expected to thoroughly engage with the questions, connect ideas from previous weeks' readings, and offer possible thoughts and answers to your classmates' responses. 

## Reflections

Reflections are meant to serve two purposes. First, <strong>before-class</strong> reflections are meant to guide your engagement with the material, encourage you to think about big-picture issues, and connect ideas spanning across different assigned materials. These reflections, together with the class annotations, also help the discussant(s) assimilate the thoughts and ideas of the class into core themes that they will highlight during class. Before-class reflections are due by 9 AM on the day of class, and can be viewed by all classmates.

Second, <strong>after-class</strong> reflections are meant to motivate you to think thoroughly about the discussion in class and reflect on your major takeaways from the class. In addition, you will also provide feedback that will be anonymously passed to the discussant in your reflections. After-class reflections are due by 9 AM on the day after class.

In addition to reflecting on the class discussion, you will also have the option to submit a meme at the end of each week, which will be entered into a "memer of the semester" contest, where you and your classmates will score the submitted memes each week. The student who has the highest score at the end of the semester will get 1 additional point added to their final grade!

## Leading discussions

You will lead two discussions in this course: a solo discussion as well as a joint discussion with another classmate. For both discussions, you are required to:

1. Present a short (3-5 minute) summary of the assigned material (preferably in slide format), focusing on central themes, questions, and methods
2. Synthesize the themes reflected in your classmates annotations and before-class reflections into 1-3 coherent themes and guide discussion on these themes during class by posing questions, moderating responses, and encouraging your classmates to think critically about the topic. 
3. Prepare an in-class activity for the group and encourage class to reflect on the activity and how it connects to the assigned materials for this week. You can choose when you want the class to engage in the activity before or after the discussion portion. You are encouraged to get in touch with me **a week BEFORE you are leading discussion** to brainstorm potential in-class activities as well as discuss your general plan for the discussion.
4. Summarize the in-class discussion.

You will be responsible for making sure the summaries, discussion, and in-class activities are all completed during class time. For <strong>joint</strong> discussions, you are welcome to assign roles (e.g., one person summarizes, other person moderates discussion, etc.) for different components, or plan and execute different components together as a team.
