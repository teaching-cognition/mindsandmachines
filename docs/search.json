    "text": "The QALMRI Method\nYou will write QALMRIs for weekly assignments as well as for your final project. This page is intended to help you understand the elements of a good and thorough QALMRI.\nAcknowledgement: The QALMRI method was first introduced by:\n\nKosslyn, S. M., & Rosenberg, R. S. (2001). Psychology: The Brain, The Person, The World. Boston: Allyn & Bacon\n\nThe description of the QALMRI method below is adapted and modified from Dr. Matthew J. C. Crump’s textbook:\n\nMatthew J. C. Crump. (2021). Instances of Cognition: Questions, Methods, Findings, Explanations, Applications, and Implications. https://crumplab.com/cognition/textbook\n\nQALMRI is an acronym for critical parts of research articles. It stands for Question, Alternatives, Logic, Method, Results, and Inference. This section demonstrates using QALMRI as a guide for reading a primary research article. QALMRI can also be used as an activity or assignment, and an example of a QALMRI assignment is given at the end.\n\nFinding a paper\nThe first step is to find a primary research article to read. To demonstrate QALMRI, I chose a paper from my own research. The article is titled, “Warning: this keyboard will deconstruct – The role of the keyboard in skilled typewriting”. This paper was published in the journal Psychonomic Bulletin and Review in 2010 and can be freely downloaded as a pdf here.\nBefore continuing, I suggest you download the paper and give it a quick glance. It it is only 5 pages long.\n\n\nAnatomy of a primary research article\nThe paper you just downloaded is an example of a primary research article. The pieces of different research articles are very similar. For example, this one has a title, an abstract, an introduction, methods and results sections for two experiments, a general discussion, and references. Most research papers have similar components:\n\nTitle: The concise title captures the main focus of the study.\nAbstract: The brief summary provides an overview of the research objectives, methods, key findings, and significance.\nIntroduction: This section presents background information, previous research, and identifies gaps in knowledge.\nMethods: The section describes the study design, sample size, data collection procedures, and statistical analysis methods.\nResults: The findings of the study are presented objectively, using data tables, figures, or graphs.\nGeneral Discussion: This section interprets the results, discusses implications, limitations, and future research directions.\nReferences: A list of cited sources, following a specific citation format, allows readers to access the cited works.\n\nBy adhering to this structure, a primary research article ensures clarity, transparency, and replicability, enabling evaluation of the study’s validity and significance.\nResearch papers are often written for a technical audience, which refers to other researchers who are already familiar with the domain. As a result, students may find it challenging to extract and comprehend major points of research articles. We will use QALMRI as an aid to help you identify and comprehend the components of a research paper.\n\n\nWhat does QALMRI stand for?\n\nQ stands for Question\nResearchers ask and answer research questions. So, your first task is to identify what questions are being asked in the research article. Research questions are usually stated in the abstract or the introduction, and sometimes they are restated near the beginning of the general discussion.\nYou may notice many different kinds of questions being stated in a research paper. It is helpful to distinguish between broad questions and specific questions. A single research paper is rarely capable of answering very broad questions, but it may have answered a specific question.\nThe paper you downloaded is about cognitive abilities mediating skilled typewriting on a computer keyboard. This topic is associated with many broad questions. For example, how do people control their own body movements? How do people learn to type without thinking about what their fingers are doing? How do people learn skills? How do people learn language? All of these questions are too big for a single research paper to answer.\nThe paper also asks specific questions. The overarching specific question is about how the feeling of the keyboard influences typing performance. People can type on keyboards with keys, or on flat surfaces without keys. How does tactile feedback from the keyboard influence typing performance?\n\n\nA stands for Alternatives\nExperimental research in cognition is often designed to test alternative explanations or hypotheses about a cognitive ability. When reading a paper you should attempt to identify the alternative explanations or hypotheses being discussed. Note also, sometimes a paper may only discuss one alternative hypothesis. More important, the alternative or hypothesis should contain an implication that can be tested later on.\nThe example paper has two major alternative ideas about cognitive processes in typing behavior. Both alternatives provide ideas about how people are able to move their fingers to individual keys very quickly and accurately, even without looking at the keyboard.\nOne possibility is that people have an internal cognitive map of the keyboard. The cognitive map represents the location of the keys on a computer, and typists may use this internal “mind” map to direct their fingers to appropriate locations while typing. An implication of the cognitive map idea is that typists may not need to rely on the feeling or touch of a keyboard in order to type quickly and accurately. Instead, their fingers can move to each key based entirely on directions from the internal map.\nAn alternative possibility is that people do not use an internal map of the keyboard. Instead, people may learn associations between the finger movements required for each keystroke and they way they feel (tactile, haptic, and proprioceptive feedback). An implication of this idea is that feeling the keyboard may be an important component of typing skill, especially for typists who learned to type on keyboards with keys.\n\n\nL stands for Logic\nThe logic of the alternatives or hypotheses is nearly identical to the hypotheses themselves, but more formally stated in terms of if/then statements. Here are two example logic statements for each of the alternatives discussed above:\nIF typists use an internal cognitive map that does not require feedback from the keyboard to guide their fingers, THEN typing performance should not be influenced by manipulations that remove tactile feedback, such as typing on keys vs a flat surface.\nIF typists use feedback from the keyboard to guide their fingers, THEN typing performance should be influenced by manipulations that remove tactile feedback, such as typing on keys vs a flat surface.\n\n\nM stands for Method\nThe method refers to the tools used to answer the research questions. More specifically, the method will usually be carefully designed to test the logical implications of the alternative explanations. In experimental research, the method will involve at least one independent variable or manipulation, and at least one dependent variable or measurement.\nIn our example, the method involved having skilled typists copy text while they were typing on keyboards with different surfaces, that provided less and less tactile feedback. The primary manipulation had four levels, and involved changing the feeling of the keyboard: there was a regular keyboard, a rubber button keyboard, a flat surface keyboard, and a laser projection keyboard. Measurements of typing performance (keystroke typing times and accuracy) were collected for each typist as they typed words on each keyboard.\n\n\nR stands for Results\nThe results are a final product of the research cycle. A given research article may present many results depending on the complexity of the method. In general, the results refer to an analysis of whether the experimental manipulation influenced the measurements.\nIn our example, typing performance was measured for four different keyboards. Results were reported in a graph and showing different measures of typing performance, such as reaction time (time to start typing a word), inter-keystroke interval (time between keystrokes), and error rate. The major result was that typing performance WAS influenced by the keyboard manipulation. Typists were fastest and most accurate on a regular keyboard, and always slower and less accurate on the keyboards with less tactile feedback.\n\n\nI stands for Inferences\nInferences may be the most important product of a research project. Inferences connect the results back to the original research questions. So, what inferences about the alternative explanations under investigation can we draw based on the results of the research? Inferences are possible if the methods do a good job of testing the logic of the alternatives.\nIn our example, the logic of the internal keyboard map idea suggested that manipulations to the feeling of the keyboard should not influence typing performance. However, the results of the study showed that reducing tactile feedback from the keyboard causes slower and more error-prone typing. So, one inference from the study could be that typists do not rely upon an internal map of the keyboard.\n\n\n\nWriting a QALMRI summary\nWriting a QALMRI for any research paper (one that you are writing, or one that you are reading) involves writing short answers to each of the QALMRI points using clear and concise language. It is a condensed, short-form, version of the research. Your task is to answer these questions:\n\nQuestion: What was the broad question? What was the specific question?\nAlternative hypotheses: What were the hypotheses?\nLogic: If hypothesis 1 was true, what was the predicted outcome? What was the predicted outcome if hypothesis 2 was true?\nMethod: What was the experimental design?\nResults: What was the pattern of data?\nInferences: What can be concluded about the hypotheses based on the data? What can be concluded about the specific and broad question? What are the next steps?\n\n\n\nExample QALMRI\nEven if you haven’t read the article, reading a QALMRI should provide you with enough information to get a basic idea of what the article was about. The following QALMRI summarizes our example article by Crump & Logan (2010).\n\nArticle citation\nArticle: Crump, M. J., & Logan, G. D. (2010). Warning: This keyboard will deconstruct—The role of the keyboard in skilled typewriting. Psychonomic bulletin & review, 17(3), 394-399.\n\nNote: The APA citation is the first thing your QALMRI summary should contain. This informs the reader (usually me) which article you have chosen to summarize.\n\n\n\nWhat was the broad and specific question?\nThe broad questions are about spatial cognition. How do people understand and represent the spatial relationships between objects in the environment? Do people have “spatial maps” in their head?\nThe specific question is how do typists know where the keys are on the QWERTY keyboard?\n\n\nWhat are the alternatives?\n\nTypists have an internal cognitive spatial map of the keyboard that they use to guide their fingers during typing\nTypists do not have a map-like representation, instead they rely on learned associations between cues such as the feel of the keyboard to guide their fingers during typing\n\n\n\nWhat is the logic?\n\nIf typists have an internal map of the keyboard, then they should be able to guide their fingers to correct locations based on the map alone and no feedback from the environment. For example, if we could measure “air-typing” without a keyboard, then typists should still be able to put their fingers in the correct locations even when the keyboard is missing because they are relying on their internal map.\nIf typists do not use an internal map of the keyboard, then their finger movements should become slow and inaccurate when they try to type without a keyboard, or in other conditions that change the normal feel of the keyboard, and thereby remove the cues that typists use to direct their fingers.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Method?\n\nNote: If a paper has multiple experiments, you are expected to report the methods and results of ALL experiments in the QALMRI, and also briefly provide reasoning about how the experiments are connected (see below).\nIn Experiment 1, typists copied paragraphs in four conditions that manipulated tactile (touching) feedback from the keyboard. They typed on a normal keyboard, a keyboard with the keys removed exposing the rubber buttons underneath, a flat circuit board without, and on a flat table with a laser projection keyboard.\nIn Experiment 2, typists performed the same task as Experiment 1, but only with the regular and laser projection keyboard. Additionally, the number of practice trials with the laser projection keyboard were increased, to evaluate whether the results of Experiment 1 could simply be explained by novetly/lack of practice with the laser projection keyboard.\n\n\n\nResults\nExperiment 1: Typists were fast and accurate in the normal keyboard condition. Typists were slow and inaccurate in all of the other keyboard conditions, where normal tactile feedback was removed.\nExperiment 2: Typists were again fast and accurate in the normal keyboard condition compared to the laser keyboard condition, despite increased practice with the laser keyboard.\n\n\nInference\nThe results are not consistent with the internal map hypothesis. If typists had an internal map, and did not rely on tactile cues, then they should have typed normally even when the cues were removed (as in the case of the laser projection keyboard). The results are consistent with learned association hypothesis, that typists rely on cues, like the feel of the keyboard, that are associated with particular key locations.\nNote: For this class, you should also reflect more broadly on the inferences in this section. You should discuss how the discussion in class elaborated on the inferences as well as any other broader themes that jumped out at you from the class session."

    "text": "The SPARK Method\nThis guide aims to help you make the most of reading review articles in psychology or summarizing an academic podcast.\nAcknowledgement: I used ChatGPT to build this section:\n\nOpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (May 24 version) [Large language model]. https://chat.openai.com/chat\n\nReview articles provide a broader understanding of a topic by integrating and summarizing existing research. Whether you’re studying psychology in a seminar course, exploring the field in a research context, or out of personal interest, this guide will help you read and engage with review articles effectively.\nAcademic podcasts seek to provide an informative, thought-provoking, and comprehensive exploration of a chosen topic. They offer a platform for in-depth conversations, where academic expertise converges with real-world applications, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the subject matter among the listeners.\n\nFinding a paper or podcast\nThe first step is to find a review article to read or a podcast to listen to. To demonstrate SPARK, we will choose the following review article:\n\nCarpenter, S. K., Pan, S. C., & Butler, A. C. (2022). The science of effective learning with spacing and retrieval practice. Nature Reviews Psychology, 1(9), 496-511.\n\nThis paper was published in the journal Nature Reviews Psychology in 2022 and can be freely downloaded as a pdf here.\nBefore continuing, please download the paper and peruse through it briefly. As you might have noticed, review articles tend to be longer than primary research articles, as they summarize several different strands of research.\nWe will also use the following podcast as an example:\n\nDeepMind Podcast: AI and neuroscience: The virtuous circle\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a review article\nReview articles typically follow some kind of structure:\n\nIntroduction: Sets the stage, explains the relevance of the topic, and outlines the objectives of the review.\nHistorical context or background: Provides a historical perspective or background information on the topic to offer context.\nThemes or subtopics covered: Organizes the content into themes or subtopics, giving you an overview of the field.\nSummary of key findings: Presents the main conclusions and key findings from the reviewed literature. Often, these findings are presented for each theme or subtopic.\nConclusion and future directions: Interim conclusions/future directions summarize the main points for each theme/subtopic and suggest avenues for future research. Broader conclusions/future directions are often at the very end of the review article, that try to bring together common ideas across themes/subtopics.\nReferences: Provides a list of sources for further exploration.\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a Podcast\nPodcasts come in several formats, but for an academic podcast, here’s a more detailed outline:\n\nHost(s) and speaker(s): Engaging hosts and knowledgeable speakers guide the conversation, providing expertise and facilitating a dynamic discussion.\nBroader questions and ideas: Each episode centers around a thought-provoking and overarching question or idea, fostering critical thinking and exploration of diverse perspectives.\nSpecific studies/findings: The podcast delves into specific studies, research findings, and scholarly work relevant to the topic, providing evidence-based insights and analysis.\nConnections and implications: The discussions draw connections between the research and its broader implications, highlighting real-world applications, potential impacts, and avenues for further exploration.\n\n\n\nWhat does SPARK stand for?\nSPARK stands for Subject, Perspectives, Analysis, Reflection, and Knowledge. Let’s explore each subpoint in more detail:\n\nS stands for Subject\nThe subject refers to the main topic being discussed in the review article or podcast. It represents the central theme or subject matter that the article or podcast aims to address. It is important to understand the significance of the chosen topic within the field of psychology. What makes it relevant, timely, or impactful? Consider how the subject contributes to existing knowledge, addresses gaps, or brings new insights to the field.\n\n\nP stands for Perspectives\nThis subpoint involves identifying the main themes or subtopics covered in the review article or podcast. Look for the different perspectives, viewpoints, or angles explored by the author(s) regarding the chosen subject. These perspectives can provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic by considering diverse viewpoints, theoretical frameworks, or empirical evidence. Consider the range of perspectives presented and how they contribute to the overall understanding of the subject.\n\n\nA stands for Analysis\nIn this stage, focus on the key findings summarized for each subtopic or theme discussed in the review article or podcast. Explore how the author(s) evaluated the evidence and drew conclusions. Consider the research studies, theories, or empirical data presented to support the key findings. Evaluate the strength of the evidence and the quality of the analysis provided. Reflect on what is currently known about the topic based on the presented evidence.\n\n\nR stands for Reflection\nThis subpoint requires examining any limitations or gaps in the reviewed literature that the authors mentioned. Consider the authors’ reflections on the existing knowledge or potential biases in the research studies reviewed. Additionally, pay attention to any suggestions made by the authors for future research directions. Reflect on the implications of the identified limitations or gaps and how they contribute to the understanding of the subject. Consider the potential areas for further investigation or improvement in the field.\n\n\nK stands for Knowledge\nThink about how reading the review article or listening to the podcast has influenced your own perspectives or raised new questions about the topic. This is also a place to reflect on the class discussion we had in a given week. Identify the key insights or findings you gained from this week’s discussion. Consider how these insights contribute to your overall understanding of the subject. Reflect on any new knowledge acquired and its potential impact on your future thinking, research, or practice within the field of psychology.\nBy following the SPARK framework, you can engage in a comprehensive analysis of a review article or podcast, extracting key information, evaluating the evidence, and gaining a deeper understanding of the chosen subject matter in the field of psychology.\n\n\n\nWriting a SPARK summary\nWriting a SPARK summary involves answering a set of questions:\n\nSubject: What is the main topic of the review article/podcast, and why is it significant in the field of psychology?\nPerspectives: What ideas or subthemes have been considered or presented?\nAnalysis: What key findings were summarized for each subtopic/theme, and how did the author(s) evaluate the evidence? What do we know so far?\nReflection: What limitations or gaps in the reviewed literature do you see or the authors highlight? What potential areas of future research do they suggest?\nKnowledge: What key insights or findings did you gain from reading the review article or listening to the podcast and the class discussion? How do these insights contribute to your understanding of the topic?\n\n\n\nExample SPARK: Review Article\nThe review article we have chosen is titled “The science of effective learning with spacing and retrieval practice.”. Below is an example SPARK summary for the article:\nArticle: Carpenter, S. K., Pan, S. C., & Butler, A. C. (2022). The science of effective learning with spacing and retrieval practice. Nature Reviews Psychology, 1(9), 496-511.\n\nNote: The APA citation is the first thing your SPARK summary should contain. This informs the reader (usually me) which article you have chosen to summarize.\n\nSubject: In the review article, the subject is effective learning, i.e., how can we be effective learners? This topic is significant because humans learn new skills and knowledge throughout their lifetime, and this knowledge helps them navigate the world around them. Therefore, knowing how to learn effectively is important - especially early in life when humans are being exposed to a large amount of new information.\nPerspectives: The review focuses on two main learning strategies: spacing and retrieval practice. Spacing is the strategy of spacing out the learning of material, and retrieval practice involves repeatedly engaging in active retrieval of the material. The review also discusses the research on metacognition and how it may contribute to the adoption and effectiveness of these strategies in real-world contexts. The research on metacognition in cognitive psychology and education is discussed.\nAnalysis:\n\nNote: This piece is likely going to be the longest part of your SPARK summary.\nThe article first discusses the research on spacing. The authors summarize a large collection of research (Table 1) across many age groups (preschool to older adults), learning materials (words, pictures, courses, etc.), and spacing implementations (how spaced does learning need to be? 30 seconds to 1-2 weeks). The broader consensus is that spacing works. There is no clear sense of what the ideal spacing schedule looks like but 1 to 7 days is a generally good ballpark. The recommendation from the authors is that the material should feel “still familiar but not fresh in the mind”. They also briefly touch on why spacing works. There are many theories, such as spacing creates “distinct learning experiences” which serve as memory cues, or that it provides a “mental break”, or that it encourages retrieval practice by forcing people to retrieve from the earlier session.\nThe article then discusses the research on retrieval practice. As before, the authors summarize many years of research (table 2) across age groups, materials, and implementation (what kind of retrieval practice? multiple-choice, true-false, cued recall, short answer, etc.), with the consensus that it works. They also emphasize how feedback is important for retrieval practice as it can help identify gaps in knowledge. They also discuss why retrieval practice works: by providing additional cues/routes to the same information and likely some neural consolidation mechanisms. Finally, they discuss that while retrieval practice is very robust for near transfer (to very similar problems/tasks), the research on far transfer is less robust.\nFinally, the authors discuss metacognition: the ability to think about one’s thinking and regulate one’s actions accordingly. They talk about how the cognitive psychology research has focused on micro-level constructs: awareness/monitoring and regulation/control. The research seems to suggest that learners are bad at both. The educational psychology research has focused on macro-level constructs: planning, goals, evaluation, motivation, and affect. This work seems to suggest that learners’ motivation is critical and may play into both awareness and regulation and thus complements the cognitive research.\n\nReflection: The authors discuss how the successful relearning could happen by combining the benefits of spacing and retrieval practice. However, they also emphasize that improving metacognition is key to successful relearning, but is also very difficult. Research suggests that simply making students aware, or giving them experience with the strategies is not sufficient. They discuss false beliefs about learning may be key here: students and teachers both may not know what strategies are effective and may believe that strategies that need more effort or time may not be as effective, contrary to what the evidence suggests. They suggest that a comprehensive framework that emphasizes knowledge, belief, commitment, and planning may be required to improve metacognition. They also discuss how it is important to truly understand learner’s perspectives in future research, as well how technology may change how stategies are implemented and adopted in the future.\nKnowledge:\n\nNote: This is where you would consolidate all the information you learned from the paper AND the class discussion.\nPersonally, I found the paper really interesting and succinct in describing the current research on effective learning strategies. When I was an undergraduate, I had very little information about what strategies worked and didn’t, and was often left to guess how I should apprach my learning. I was good in some courses and not so good at others, and it was very unclear if it was my learning style, my motivation, or the environment. Knowing what I know now would have been really helpful! I would have liked to know a bit more about interventions that target motivational or affective aspects of metacognition.\n\n\n\nExample SPARK: Podcast\nThe podcast we have chosen is titled “AI and neuroscience: The virtuous circle”. Below is an example SPARK summary for the podcast:\nPodcast: DeepMind Podcast: AI and neuroscience: The virtuous circle\n\nNote: The citation is the first thing your SPARK summary should contain. This informs the reader (usually me) which article/podcast you have chosen to summarize.\n\nSubject: The podcast discusses the goals of artificial intelligence, what it means for a machine to be intelligent, and how closely should it mimic human/animal minds. These ideas/questions are important as we are living in a world where artificial systems are all around us, and so understanding the motivations of the researchers behind these tools is important, just as important as figuring out exactly how AI learns from or builds on neuroscience.\nPerspectives: Hannah Fry (the host) talks to Demis Hassabis the founder of DeepMind, as well as other scientists in the podcasts, such as Jess Hamrick, Matt Botvinick, Greg Wayne. They first discuss what the goals and potential of AI is: what can AI achieve and what should we want it to achieve? They next discuss how AI has learned from and can learn from human and animal minds. They talk about the idea of Moravec’s paradox: where the seemingly simple things humans do turn out to be the most complex things to program in an AI. Finally, they discuss how AI has also informed and advanced neuroscience.\nAnalysis:\n\nGoals: Demis believes that AI could be used to solve humanity’s biggest problems, such as climate change, cancer, language, energy, etc. But to achieve all this, we need to decide what kind of AI do we want to build - should it be like a human or completely different? Hamrick weighs in on this and says that it is important for AI to be a little bit like us because if AI systems are deployed in the real world and they are not like us, or don’t think like us, then there will be no trust in them and this lack of understanding what it’s doing will make its use problematic. Fry discusses the case of an AI trained to diagnose skin cancer using images, where the AI was making judgments based on random information (a ruler in the photos). Botvinick discusses how AI needs to definitely “think like a human” in some ways but may need to go beyond that. They discuss the Wright brothers and how the idea originated from observing birds for years but then moving a step ahead to make planes.\nNeuroscience inspiration: Fry discusses the idea of replay in human and animal brains, where past experiences are replayed over and over, which has been recast into reinforcement learning in AI, where the program remembers and learns from previous plays to inform future plays in games. Hamrick discusses the idea of mental simulation and how it helps us make predictions about the world, something that AI systems are also using now. Wayne discusses animal research on scrub jays and their ability to remember information about where they have stored their food on very long time scales.\nReward: Fry describes how AI systems learn in the first place: not through rules, but through keeping track of 0s and 1s and learning through prediction, i.e., by predicting when a reward might occur, the system learns a particular behavior.\nMoravec’s paradox: Fry discusses the overarching theme that emerges from these discussions: that tasks that are seemingly simple for humans such as sitting, picking things up, etc. are the ones that are very hard to teach machines. But with advances in neuroscience and AI, Hassabis thinks this no longer needs to be a barrier as we have begun to understand how vision works through pattern recognition, etc.\nAI back to neuroscience: Botvinick discusses the research on dopamine, where they were trying to understand why dopamine is released in the brain. The brain research came across computer scientists who were working on reinforcement learning, which led to a revolution in neuroscience: dopamine wasn’t the response to the reward, but it was the prediction error (what was the expectation vs. what was received).\n\nReflection: Overall, this podcast introduced a lot of exciting themes and questions. The host reflected on the history of the field in tandem with developments in neuroscience and where the current research is heading in AI. There appear to be many different motives and ideas in the field.\nKnowledge:\n\nNote: This is where you would consolidate all the information you learned from the paper AND the class discussion.\nI found the podcast interesting and learned quite a bit! As a cognitive scientist, it was interesting for me to learn some of the early connections between neuroscience and AI, and how it truly is a circle. I am curious to know more about how different cognitive aspects of the human/animal mind may be essential vs. exciting to implement in artificial systems."

Pre-requisites: Three of:\n\nEither PSYC 2040 or PSYC 2060 (same as NEUR 2060)\nPSYC 2510\nPSYC 2520\n\n\n\n\n Abhilasha Kumar: Hear my name! Pronouns: she/her\nAbout me: I am a cognitive scientist who is fascinated by how humans think, learn, and communicate. My work involves conducting psychological experiments to understand different aspects of human behavior such as how we learn the meaning of words, how we search for information, and how we cooperate with one another. When I am not working, I enjoy playing board games, learning new recipes, and playing tennis (badly)! \nEmail: a.kumar@bowdoin.edu\nOffice: Kanbar Hall, Room 217\n\n\n\n\nTuesdays, 1-2 pm\nTuesdays, 5-6 pm\nThursdays, 9-10 am\nThursdays, 4.20-5.30 pm\n\nYou are strongly encouraged to drop-in during student/office hours - this is time specifically dedicated to you and any thoughts, questions, or concerns you may wish to share with me. If the designated hours don’t work for you, please email me to find a different time.\n\n\n\nWhy are humans considered the most “intelligent” species on the planet? Are there other minds around us that display intelligent behavior? Where does artificial intelligence (AI) fall short in mimicking intelligent behavior? This seminar course delves into several such fundamental questions about human cognition/intelligence and how our species is similar to and different from other minds and machines. We will discuss classic and modern approaches to understanding the mind, critically analyze various examples of intelligent behavior (such as language, perception, cooperation, sentience, etc.), evaluate recent work in machine learning and AI, and also draw insights about intelligence from the exciting literature on comparative (animal) cognition. You will read empirical articles, listen to podcasts, lead discussions, and also participate through spoken presentations and short writing assignments.\n\n\n\nThe last few years have seen impressive highs and lows in the study and pursuit of intelligence. Through this course, I hope to communicate some of the excitement and skepticism that researchers in the field feel today. At the end of this course, you will be able to: \n\nEvaluate scientific approaches to defining, understanding, and building intelligences [Department Goal #4]\nReflect on your own and other’s perspectives on the cultural and ethical issues surrounding the study of intelligence [Department Goal #3]\nProduce original critiques on different aspects of intelligence [Department Goal #7]\n\n\n\n\nAll of the course materials will be available in a timely fashion on this course website and/or posted on Canvas.\nStudents do not need to purchase or download any textbook - all readings will be made available (or are already available) on this course website or on Canvas\n\n\n\nThere are 15 total weeks in this course. Weekly learning modules will cover different subtopics in the study of intelligence (e.g., language, perception, complex cognition, etc.). Students will lead 2 discussions during the semester (1 solo and 1 paired) and are also expected to complete weekly assignments and a project. All assignments provide opportunities to earn up to 100 points (+5 extra credit) toward a final grade.\nThis is an in-person class, and students are expected to attend all class sessions.\n\n\n\nThis course will briefly touch upon the history and practice of psychology and cognition. In doing so, we will cover some problematic and disturbing parts of history, including the Eugenics movement, the Holocaust, and their connection to intelligence testing and racism. These themes may also be revisited at later points in the course. You may find this content sexist, racist, homophobic, and/or otherwise unpleasant. Please know that our goal is not to endorse these attitudes but in fact acknowledge the part psychology has played in perpetuating these exclusionary ideologies throughout history. I understand, however, that some of this content may be difficult and upsetting. To that end, there are multiple ways to engage with the content via different types of assignments. I encourage you to push yourself, but also respect your limits and boundaries. If you are aware of any particular course material that may be traumatizing to you, please come talk to me and we can discuss alternative options for you to engage with the material. I will try my best to provide verbal reminders about such content ahead of time so that you are prepared and feel comfortable reaching out.\n\n\n\nWeekly learning modules include three components to encourage engagement with the domain of intelligence in different ways.\nREAD: Modules have assigned readings from primary research articles or textbook chapters, and occasional podcast episodes. All material is freely available and posted on Canvas or the course website. Student are expected to read assigned material before classes where the material is discussed.\nANNOTATE: Students are expected to submit annotations for the class readings before each class. These annotations will serve as the jumping-off point for class discussions every week (see more details about annotations here)\nREFLECT: Modules usually involve two class meetings. Classes will involve a mixture of student and instructor-led discussions, group work, and activities and students are expected to actively participate in class. At the end of the week, you will be expected to reflect on the content covered during the week via guided and/or open-ended reflections, or project work."

Students are encouraged to choose the assignments that work best for them. Course assessments that occur throughout the semester are designed to help students set and achieve their own goals for engaging in course content.\n\nPoints\n\n\n\nComponent\nPoints\nLearning goal\n\n\n\n\nWeekly annotations\n10\nEvaluate, Produce\n\n\nReflections\n20\nEvaluate, Produce\n\n\nClass participation\n10\nProduce, Reflect\n\n\nLeading discussions\n20\nEvaluate, Produce, Reflect\n\n\nFinal project\n40\nEvaluate, Produce\n\n\nExtra credit\n5\nReflect\n\n\nTotal\n105\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly annotations (10 points)\nFor the research articles that you will read during the week, you are required to submit annotations and/or respond to your classmates’ annotations by 9 PM the day before class, using the Hypothes.is tool within Canvas. Annotations are visible to all classmates. One annotation is required per reading, but you are welcome to annotate more (but please be mindful, and demure of the discussion leader’s workload)! Annotations should not exceed 50 words. The goal of these annotations is to stimulate the in-class discussions. Overall, these annotations contribute 10 points towards your final grade, but each annotation will be graded on a 1-point scale and then scaled to total up to 10 points at the end of the semester. The 1-point grading scale for each annotation is as follows:\n\n\n\nDescriptor\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted a thoughtful annotation\n1\n\n\nSubmitted a low-effort annotation\n0.5\n\n\nDid not submit an annotation\n0\n\n\n\nYour annotations should reflect your engagement with the material and you are encouraged to ask thoughtful questions as you go. Annotations can be about any specific part of the reading/material, such as questions about the logic, clarity, technical soundness, as well as implications of the arguments, or even your reflections on any part of the reading. Treat these annotations as a first reaction to the content being discussed. Please remember to be thoughtful and respectful of your classmates’ ideas and opinions as you make and view annotations.\nNote: You are not required to submit any annotations for the day you are scheduled to lead the discussion.\n\n\nReflections (20 points)\nThe material we cover each class will either be an empirical article (that describes one or a series of experiments targeted towards one key question), a review paper (that consolidates many empirical articles), or a podcast (that discusses a range of articles and themes). Based on the material we cover, every week that you do not have a project milestone due, you will be expected to submit a reflection - this reflection will sometimes ask you to summarize one or two articles’ key ideas, or may at other times ask you to respond to an open-ended prompt. The goal of this assignment is to allow you a chance to revisit the class discussion and respond to the material in a deeper manner.\nPlease note that all assignments must be submitted before the due date each week to count towards the final grade - late submissions will NOT be accepted (unless you are using a flex day, see late work policy). Overall, these reflections contribute 20 points towards your final grade, but each reflection will be graded on a 5-point scale and then scaled to total up to 20 points at the end of the semester. The grading scale for each summary is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptor\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding, thoughtful assignment with no logical and/or writing flaws\n5\n\n\nVery good assignment with some minor flaws\n4\n\n\nAssignment demonstrates competency but some significant weaknesses\n3\n\n\nAssignment demonstrates competency but some major weaknesses\n2\n\n\nDoes not meet expectations\n0-1\n\n\n\n\n\nClass participation (10 points)\nStudents are encouraged to participate during class by responding to and reflecting on the course content, as well as engaging with other students via activities and group work. Your attendance will also count for some part of your class participation.\nOverall, here is a breakdown of how class participation will be assessed:\n\n\n\nComponent\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nIn-class participation and/or attending office hours\n2.5\n\n\nPeer review for project draft\n5\n\n\nAttendance (attending 90% of classes)\n2.5\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nIn-class participation will be assessed based on how engaged you are in or outside class - I will be looking for engagement via participating in in-class activities, asking questions, volunteering answers, etc. on an overall basis.\nYou will complete a final project in this class, as part of which you and your classmates will submit an initial draft for feedback. This initial draft will be reviewed by me (the professor) as well as a peer. Thus, you will be reviewing another classmate’s draft and providing them feedback on the same. You will be provided guidance on how to effectively review someone else’s work and provide them with constructive feedback. Your review will count towards class participation. Completing a detailed and thoughtful review will earn you the 5 points that contribute towards your final grade.\nAttendance will be taken for each class and you will get full credit if you attend at least 90% of the class sessions. Beyond that, you will be assigned partial credit based on the number of classes you miss, i.e., 0.5 point will be deducted for each 10% drop in attendance (e.g., if you attend 80% of the classes, you will earn 2 points out of 2.5, if you attend 70% of the classes, you will earn 1.5 points out of 2.5, etc.)\n\n\nLeading discussions (20 points)\nYou will lead three discussions in this course: a solo discussion as well as two group discussions with one or two classmates. For all discussions, you are encouraged to get in touch with me a week BEFORE you are leading discussion to discuss your general plan for the discussion.\nThe SCHEDULE for discussions this semester is available here!\nPlease review these guidelines BEFORE our meeting so that you are best prepared with ideas and questions.\nDuring class, you will be required to:\n\nPresent a short (3-5 minute) summary of the assigned material, focusing on central themes, questions, and methods\nSynthesize your classmates annotations into 1-3 coherent themes and guide discussion on these themes during class by posing questions, moderating responses, and encouraging your classmates to think critically about the topic.\nPrepare an in-class activity for the group and encourage the class to reflect on the activity and how it connects to the assigned materials for this week. You can choose whether you want the class to engage in the activity before or after the discussion portion. You can brainstorm ideas for the class activity with me during our meeting.\nSummarize the in-class discussion.\n\nYou will be responsible for making sure the summaries, discussion, and in-class activities are all completed during class time. For joint discussions, you are welcome to assign roles (e.g., one person summarizes, other person moderates discussion, etc.) for different components, or plan and execute different components together as a team.\nBelow are some general resources for leading effective discussions:\n\nHow to Lead a Class Discussion by Rachel Seidman\nLeading an Effective Discussion, Samuel Schaffer and Alison Green\nActive Learning Techniques, Duke University\n\n\n\nFinal Project (40 points)\nYou will also work on a final project for this class. This project is intended to help you (1) engage with empirical research on intelligence and (2) creatively communicate the material to a broader audience.\nThis project will give you the opportunity to showcase your knowledge of the study of intelligence by applying what you know to a topic that interests you. This project is intentionally open-ended in order to accommodate the broad range of interests, skills, and abilities represented in this class. As long as your project achieves the two objectives listed above, then you are on the right track!\nYour project may take on different forms and we will collaboratively work towards some acceptable formats in class (e.g., short story, video, podcast, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\nMilestones\nRegardless of what final form your project takes, there will be several formative low-stakes milestones during the semester to ensure you are making steady progress towards the final project. The breakdown of how the milestones contribute to your final project grade is below:\n\n\n\nMilestone\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nQuestions of interest\n2.5\n\n\nQALMRI + SPARK for research articles\n10\n\n\nProject plan/outline\n5\n\n\nFirst draft\n2.5\n\n\nFinal submission\n20\n\n\nTotal\n40\n\n\n\n\nMilestone 1: Questions of Interest (2.5 points)\nThis assessment will happen relatively early in the semester to ensure that you are clear on the different demands of the project options and are actively thinking about what questions you’d like to explore through this project. This assessment will be graded for thoughtful effort, i.e., I want to see that you have made an effort to select the option that best aligns with your goals for this class.\n\n\nMilestone 2: QALMRI for research articles (10 points)\nThis assessment will help you organize your literature review and structure your analysis and/or writing/designing. You will prepare a list of 1 review and 5 primary/empirical research articles relevant to your project and submit SPARK/QALMRI reports for each of the articles. This will help you understand the research articles in detail and enable you to ultimately connect ideas across readings.\n\n\nMilestone 3: Project plan/outline (5 points)\nThis assessment is intended to help you organize your overall plan for the final project. The specifics of the plan/outline will vary based on your chosen project, but you will be required to submit a rough outline/plan. This assessment will be graded for thoughtful effort, i.e., I want to see that you are making steady progress on your project and are able to integrate the research articles you have read with key arguments/analyses.\n\n\nMilestone 4: First draft (2.5 points)\nThis assessment is intended to provide you feedback on an early draft The goal is to make sure you are on track to submitting a strong final project. This assessment will be graded for thoughtful effort, i.e., I want to see that you are making steady progress on your project.\n\n\nMilestone 5: Final submission (20 points)\nThis final assessment will require you to submit your final project and all its components. The specifics of your submission will vary based on your chosen project, so please refer to the details of your project to make sure you submit all required materials.\n\n\n\n\nExtra credit (5 points)\nThere will be some opportunities to earn extra credit during the semester. These opportunities are described below:\n\nComplete class surveys (2 points) : There will be 3 surveys during the semester to gather your reflections and suggestions to improve the course. With the exception of the pre-class survey (which is mandatory), all other surveys will be anonymous, and you will be able to earn 1 point for each survey you complete.\nWin Discussion Dynamo (1 point): Each time you lead discussion in class, I will provide you feedback on the same. The two students who receive the highest overall discussion score during the semester for leading great discussions will earn 1 extra credit each.\n Win Team Player (1 point) : Throughout the course, I will also evaluate who stood out as a team player during class discussions and activities, by observing how you participate in groups and consider your peers’ perspectives. The student who receives the overall highest score at the end of the semester will earn 1 extra credit.\n Win Memer of the Semester (1 point) : Each week, you will have the opportunity to submit a meme via Canvas, that reflects your experience with the course content of that week. Memes should be original, i.e., they should be course-specific and something you have created yourself and not simply found on the internet, although you are allowed to use common images/tropes from popular memes as a starting point. Memes also need to have a specific format, with the title of the learning module at the top of the meme (see Canvas). All memes will be gathered and sent to the class anonymously at the end of the semester for a survey, and the student(s) with the average highest score and the best scoring meme will both receive 1 additional point. Note: A student can only receive a maximum of 1 point through this mechanism, even if the same student has the highest average score in the context and the best scoring meme."

    "href": "articles/course_docs/syllabus.html#course-policies",
    "title": "Syllabus",
    "section": "Course Policies",
    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAcademic honesty and plagiarism\nWe, as a class, will abide by the Bowdoin College Academic Honor Code. While you are encouraged to discuss ideas and thoughts with your classmates, plagiarism in any form will be subject to grade reductions and disciplinary action. Specifically, you are permitted to make use of online resources and/or search platforms. However, directly copying or adapting written material and/or your classmates’ answers or ideas will be considered plagiarism. This policy applies to both individual and group assignments.\nPlease refer to this page for a list of resources related to plagiarism and other academic integrity issues. Here is another helpful infographic about plagiarism that you are encouraged to go over.\n\n\nUse of generative artificial intelligence tools\nAcknowledgement: This policy about generative AI was generated using the Generative AI Syllabus Statement Tool provided by Seaver College\nGenerative artificial intelligence tools — software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, video, and other content—have become widely available. Well-known examples include ChatGPT/Bard for text and DALL-E for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our semester together. You may use generative AI tools for work in this course to help with idea generation, literature review, drafting, and other such academic work. If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. Cite the tool you used, following the pattern for computer software provided by the American Psychological Association (APA) guide. If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are typically trained on limited datasets that may be out of date. Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in plagiarism or copyright violations. Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content. It is your responsibility as a scholar — NOT the tool’s — to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. Although you have wide latitude to determine how you use generative AI tools in this course, you must be wary of unintentional plagiarism or fabrication of data. Please act with integrity, for the sake of both your personal character and your academic record.\n\n\nElectronic devices\nMost of our class time will be spent in active discussions and in-person/online activities. Therefore, while you are welcome to bring a Macbook/iPad to class please put away your device unless you are asked to refer to it by the discussion leader/moderator. Please make sure that your device is charged when you arrive to class. In order to minimize distractions, please close or exit out of all other programs except those needed during class, and put your Mac/iPad on “work” mode. All class time should be devoted to working on in-class activities and group projects.\n\n\nAttendance: How many classes can you miss?\nIt not only benefits your learning, but benefits all of our learning to be present together in the same space. Class time is designed to take advantage of our presence together. To that end, your attendance will count towards your class participation.\nOf course, emergencies (illness or family emergencies) can and do occur. Note: If you are sick, please stay home. However, I would greatly appreciate that you email me if you will be missing class. If you miss more than 2 classes and I haven’t heard from you, I will be in touch to check in on you. Hopefully you will have connections to other students in the class and can find out what you missed from a classmate. I will also try my best to upload slides and other course materials on the website and/or on Canvas.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nSometimes, life doesn’t go as planned and you have way too much going on to turn things in on time. That is OKAY! This course has the following policies for late work:\n\nEach student has 3 “flex” days that they can use at their discretion throughout the semester. You can use all 3 days at once for a single assignment and turn in one assignment 3 days late (with no questions asked), OR you can spread the love across different assignments.\nIf you need to turn in work late and do not have any flex days left, I will consider extensions based on legitimate reasons, which ONLY include verified illnesses and/or family emergencies. In these cases, you are encouraged to reach out to me at least 24 hours in advance of the due date.\n\nWork that is handed in late beyond the flex days or without an approved extension will automatically be graded on 50% of the original points.\nUsing ONE flex day means you get a 24-hour extension. Please note that this is a strict extension and any work that is handed in beyond 24 hours after a flex day was requested will either need to use an additional flex day or will be graded on 50% of the original points.\nTo request a flex day, you can send me an email within the 24-hour extension window, or leave a comment on your submitted assignment on Canvas.\n\n\n\nInclusion\nI will do my very best to ensure that students from all backgrounds and perspectives receive equitable access and opportunity in this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity students bring to this class is viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. I hope to employ materials and engage in activities and dialogue that are respectful of different aspects of your identity.\n\n\nReligious Holidays\nNo student is required to take an examination or fulfill other scheduled course requirements on recognized religious holidays. Students are expected to declare their intention to observe these holidays at the beginning of the semester.\n\n\nAccommodations\nStudents with documented Bowdoin-granted accommodations have a right to have these met. I encourage you to see me in the first 2 weeks of class to discuss how your accommodations may support your learning process in this course. I highly encourage all students to meet with me in the first few weeks of class to discuss your learning preferences, challenges you may face learning this semester, and how we can create an effective learning experience for you. If you are interested in learning more about accommodations please see Lesley Levy in the Office of Student Accessibility or visit Bowdoin’s website on accessibility-related policies and resources.\n\n\nCounseling Resources\nAs a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduced ability to participate in daily activities. Bowdoin College is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus at this link. The Dean of Students Office is also a resource for students facing personal and academic challenges. I encourage you to reach out to the amazing people in the dean’s office for a meeting anytime.\n\n\nLearning Resources\nThe Baldwin Center for Learning and Teaching offers peer-to-peer resources including mentors, Q-Tutors, and Writing Assistants. If you or your family are multilingual, you may also take advantage of Lisa Flanagan to work on writing and speaking assignments and projects. Tina Chong is available as an Academic Coach to work with you on goal setting, managing time, study habits and other strategies to support academic success. You are encouraged to make an appointment and learn more about how the Center can support your learning.\n\n\nOther resources\nIf you are on a budget or would benefit from financial assistance of any kind at any point in the semester, I encourage you to contact your Dean and explore the Supplemental and Emergency Funding website. The Office of the Dean of Students has grant and loan funds available to remove financial barriers so that students can more fully access the Bowdoin experience or to assist students with unexpected financial needs.\n\n\nMandated Reporter\nAs a faculty member, I am considered a Responsible Employee, per the Student Sexual Misconduct and Gender Based Violence Policy. As a Responsible Employee I am required to report disclosures of sexual misconduct, dating violence, stalking, and/or sexual and gender-based harassment to Bowdoin’s Title IX Coordinator, Kate O’Grady. My reporting does NOT mean that any actions will be taken beyond Kate reaching out to you and trying to schedule a time to talk to see what assistance you might need to be successful as a student here at Bowdoin. For more information please check out Bowdoin’s Title IX page."

Then, move on to the next learning module.\n\n\nWriting Option 1: Explain the exemplar model (6 points)\nThe reading for this chapter as well as the class lectures described the exemplar model of categorization. Your task for this assignment is to explain the following in at least 250 words:\n\nDescribe how the similarity between different cartoon stimuli was determined in the model.\nDescribe how seeing a new cartoon face would activate different cartoon faces based on the exemplar model.\nDescribe how a decision is reached based on these activations.\n\n\n\nWriting Option 2: Examining the trends in psychology (6 points)\nIn this assignment, you will use Google’s n-gram viewer to chart out the frequency of different terms/ideas found in sources printed from 1500 and 2019. Your task is to:\n\nSpecify a time range for the period you want to explore. I would suggest 1900-2019 but feel free to explore other time periods.\nSpecify a collection of terms/ideologies from the learning modules so far whose frequencies you want to explore.\nSome suggestions for terms:\n\n\nDifferent terms can be graphed using different lines if you separate them by commas (e.g., Winston Churchill, Barack Obama, Mahatma Gandhi).\nIf you want a combined line for some terms, you can use the + sign and parentheses (e.g., (Mahatma Gandhi + Mother Teresa) )\n\n\nMake sure “case-insensitive” is not selected/highlighted: we don’t care about capitalizations vs. lowercase frequencies.\n\nThis is a fairly open-ended assignment. Your task is to analyze the plot you obtain from the n-gram viewer for different cognitive terms and interpret the plot. For example, you may look at trends for behaviorism vs. (cognitive psychology + cognitive science) vs. eugenics. Some questions you should address are:\n\nWhat is the pattern of EACH line?\nIs there a bump/rise and fall for some terms? When do these bumps appear? Does it align with the history we’ve explored so far?\nIf the pattern does not align with your expectations, what might be some possible reasons?\n\nYour assignment should contain your final graph and its analysis in at least 250 words."

This is an open-ended prompt for you to reflect on your own language experiences and then describe why it is interesting and what it might tell us about how language processes work.\nHere are some example topics. Have you ever accidentally said a word you didn’t mean to say? Have you temporarily forgotten a word that you know you know? Are you really good at saying words really fast? Have you had trouble learning new words? Have you ever thought you knew the meaning of a word, but later found out that the word didn’t mean what you thought it meant? Have you mixed up words from your native language when speaking in your other fluent language?\nAny of those examples and more would be suitable for the assignment.

Then, move on to the next learning module.\n\n\nWriting Option 1: Apply a cognitive bias to real life (6 points)\nThere are many known cognitive biases that may influence how people make judgments and decisions. This wikipedia list provides a fairly comprehensive list of known biases, in addition to the ones we discussed in class:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases\n\nPick any cognitive bias from the above list\nProvide a brief definition/example of the cognitive bias that you chose\nGenerate two real-world scenarios where you would expect the cognitive bias to influence a person’s judgment and decision-making process.\n\nHere is an example of a completed assignment, but you will have to use a different cognitive bias.\nAnchoring bias\nDefinition: The anchoring bias occurs when judgments are biased toward a salient and potentially arbitrary stimulus that serves as the anchor. For example, a small number could be presented as an anchor, and later judgments about quantities could be biased toward smaller numbers because the anchoring stimulus was a small number.\nReal-world Example 1: A used car lot lists the sale prices of cars as much higher than they are worth. These prices serve as anchors, and they may bias potential buyers to make offers that are closer to the anchor value (higher than the car is worth), compared to the real value of the car.\nReal-world Example 2: The first dish you taste at a new restaurant was way too salty. As you taste other dishes you are biased to judge them as over-salted as well.\n\n\nWriting Option 2: Write a QALMRI (6 points)\nFor this assignment, you will write a QALMRI report for the following paper:\n\nBhatia, S. (2017). Conflict and bias in heuristic judgment. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 43(2), 319.\n\n\n\nWriting Option 3: Answer two short-answer questions (6 points)\nAnswer the following questions:\n\nWhat is the representativeness heuristics? What are some biases that occur due to this heuristic?\nWhat is the availability heuristic? Describe one study that looks at the availability heuristic OR investigates “what comes to mind”."

For example, some people claim to have a photographic memory. Other people have performed astounding feats of memory like memorizing tens of thousands of digits of the number pi, and then reciting them perfectly in a row (e.g., look up Daniel Tammet). Your assignment is to find and evaluate an extraordinary claim about memory.
