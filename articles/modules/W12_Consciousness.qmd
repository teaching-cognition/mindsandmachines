## Engage {.mt-5}

When you are ready complete any or all of the following assignments.

1. QUESTION: Submit a conceptual question on Canvas (counts for class participation)
2. QUIZ: Complete the L10: Social Cognition quiz (6 points, on Canvas)
3. WRITING: There are two options to choose from (6 points, instructions below, submit on Canvas)
4. REFLECT: Submit a meme for the Memer of the Semester contest on Canvas (2 extra credit points for winner at the end of the semester)
Submit your work before the due date posted on Canvas. Then, move on to the next learning module.

### Writing Option 1: Reflect on a DeepMind podcast (6 points)

This assignment explores the world of cooperative artificial intelligence via a podcast. Your task is to listen to the DeepMind podcast, [*Better Together*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9IOXa-iXKY) and reflect on what you learned from the podcast. In your reflection, you must discuss 3 things you learned that you did not know and whether that has changed your view of social behavior in humans vs. machines. You should write a **minimum of 250 words**, but feel free to write more. Submit your document on Canvas by the due date.

### Writing Option 2: Reflect on a Trust Game (6 points)

We have spent a lot of time in this course thinking about the *how* behind different instances of cognition. This assignment encourages you to think about the *why* behind cooperative behavior. Your task is to play the [Trust Game](https://ncase.me/trust/) and reflect on the big takeaways from the game through the following questions:

1. Were you surprised by the outcomes of the simulations?
2. Do you think the game captures cooperative situations in the real world? Why and why not?
3. Do you think there are situations where cooperation may not be the best strategy? Why and why not?

You should write a **minimum of 250 words**, but feel free to write more. Submit your document on Canvas by the due date.

### Writing Option 3: Answer two short-answer questions (6 points)

Answer the following questions:

- Describe an experiment that showed that children can evaluate the informativeness of a teacher and adjust their behavior accordingly. Your description should include the following details: independent variable(s), dependent variable(s), key finding(s), and inference(s) .

- Describe an experiment that showed that children engage in overimitation. Your description should include the following details: independent variable(s), dependent variable(s), key finding(s), and inference(s) .
