## Goals

- Introduce early work on associationism in humans and non-human animals
- Connect ideas of learning associations to classical conditioning

### Writing Option 1: QALMRI for paper on associative strength and free recall (6 points)

Classical conditioning and associative learning influence a wide range of psychological processes. Your assignment is to write a QALMRI summary for the following paper.

- Deese, J. (1959). Influence of inter-item associative strength upon immediate free recall. Psychological Reports, 5(3), 305-312.

Using [the QALMRI method](https://teaching-cognition.github.io/cognition/textbook/C1_What_is_Cognition.html#the-qalmri-method), write a one-page QALMRI (point form is OK) of the assigned paper. You can also refer to the [QALMRI tutorial](https://teaching-cognition.github.io/cognition/articles/modules/QALMRI.html) for detailed instructions on how to write a QALMRI.

- Question: Identify the big and specific question
- Alternatives: What are the alternative hypotheses or explanations
- Logic: What are the logical implications of the hypotheses
- Method: Describe the Methods
- Results: What was the main result
- Inference: What inferences about the hypothesis are made from the results?

### Writing Option 2: Blocking in the Rescorla-Wagner model (6 points)

In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to work through the Rescorla-Wagner model and explain the "blocking" effect discussed in class using some simulated data available [at this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xiNoRbGkSoAJeyIjLADINKyzGXW03kY_/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=114230382498081849934&rtpof=true&sd=true) 

Assume that after learning about an association between an unconditioned stimulus (Stimulus 1) and a conditioned response for 6 trials, a new stimulus (Stimulus 2) is introduced. On each subsequent trial, Stimulus 1 and 2 are presented together, and we record the changes in the learning as per the RW model equation. 

Download the excel file from the link above (use File > Download), inspect the different columns, and answer the following questions:

1. What are the two tables in the excel file showing? Describe each column and how its value is calculated. Hint: You can click on a particular cell and it will show you the formula that is used to calculate the value.

2. Plot the column that contain the values of Vnew for stimulus 2. Hint: Use Insert > Chart and pick one of the line charts.

3. What do you see - is learning happening for Stimulus 2? Why or why not? Describe your reasoning process.
