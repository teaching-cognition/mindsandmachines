### Textbook Chapter: Information Processing
Describes cognition from the information processing tradition including processing stages, information, and capacity limitations, which became popular research topics around the 1950s and 60s.

### Writing Option 1: Hick-Hyman law (6 points)

The textbook chapter discussed choice reaction time experiments and the Hick-Hyman law. Your writing assignment is to explain the following:

1. Describe what the set-size effect refers to in a choice-reaction time experiment.

2. Describe what the Hick-Hyman law refers to.

3. Explain the repetition priming confound, and describe how repetition priming could explain performance in choice-reaction time tasks showing evidence of the Hick-Hyman law. (Hint: review section 7.8.7.4 in the textbook)

### Writing Option 2: Reflect on Turing's paper (6 points)

In class, we briefly discussed Alan Turing's idea of "imitation game" and how it continues to influence the study of cognition. In this writing assignment, you get to read Turing's original paper (available on Canvas):

- Turing, A. M. (1950). Computing Machine and Intelligence. *MIND*, *LIX*, 433-460. 

The paper is long, but feel free to read as much as you find interesting (I recommend reading at least up to page 10). In your response (at least 250 words), you should specify the pages you read and whether or not you think the test proposed by Turing is an appropriate measure of intelligence and/or cognition.
