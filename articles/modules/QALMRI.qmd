This page consists resources for writing QALMRI reports of research articles. You will write QALMRIs for writing assignments as well as through your final project. This page is intended to help you understand the elements of a good and thorough QALMRI.

### Step 1: Review the QALMRI method

Review the [QALMRI method here](https://teaching-cognition.github.io/cognition/textbook/C1_What_is_Cognition.html#the-qalmri-method).

### Step 2: Watch Dr. Crump's Mini Lecture on reading primary research

This mini-lecture gives a primer on reading primary research, and the QALMRI method.

### Step 4: Plan and write your QALMRI

1. **Find an article**: You can search [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) for new papers, or you can read the table of contents of journals online. Check out this [list of cognitive journals from the course website](https://www.teaching-cognition.github.io/cognition/articles/course_docs/resources.html). Choose any article that is about cognition and looks interesting to you.
2. **Obtain the article**: You should be able to download most journal articles through the Bowdoin College Library Catalogue. You may also be able to find copies online via Google Scholar.
3. **Read the article**: Scan the article to see what it is about. Your goal will be to write a QALMRI to help you make sense of the article
4. **Write a QALMRI**: Using [the QALMRI method](https://teaching-cognition.github.io/cognition/textbook/C1_What_is_Cognition.html#the-qalmri-method), write a one-page QALMRI (point form is OK) of the paper you chose.

- Question: Identify the big and specific question
- Alternatives: What are the alternative hypotheses or explanations
- Logic: What are the logical implications of the hypotheses
- Method: Describe the Methods
- Results: What was the main result
- Inference: What inferences about the hypothesis are made from the results?

It is OK if you find the research article confusing. The purpose of this exercise is to try as best as you can, and get a general sense of what it is like to search for and read articles in cognition.
