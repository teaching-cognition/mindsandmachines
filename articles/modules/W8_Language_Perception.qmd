### Textbook Chapter: Memory I
We're back with Dr. Crump! This chapter overviews the beginnings of memory research in cognition, covering a few early researchers, the emergence of different research traditions in the study of memory, and the information-processing approach to memory.

### Writing Option 1: Incredible memory claims assignment (6 points)

This assignment asks you to do a little bit of research on incredible memory claims. For example, some people claim to have a photographic memory. Other people have performed astounding feats of memory like memorizing tens of thousands of digits of the number pi, and then reciting them perfectly in a row (e.g., look up Daniel Tammet). Your assignment is to find and evaluate an extraordinary claim about memory. It could be any claim you have heard before about memory, or you could research a bit and potentially discover claims being made about memory that are new to you.

1. State the claim about memory, and if possible where you found it.

2. Find evidence for the claim. Try to find some evidence for or against the claim and describe it.

3. Critically evaluate the claim and the evidence. Does the claim seem plausible to you? Does the evidence seem credible? If you couldn't find any evidence of the claim, what kind of evidence would you want to have to evaluate the claim.

Your assignment should be at least 250 words.


## Writing Option 2: React to a video (6 points)

In this assignment, you will watch a video created by Vox and Netflix about how memory works, [Memory, Explained](https://youtu.be/d95dOH-7GHM) and assess the validity of the different claims they make in the video. You may be able to use the reading for this week as a starting point but might need to do additional research for some of the other claims. 

In at least 250 words, you should reflect on the video by:

1. Identifying at least 2 claims about memory that the video makes
2. Finding evidence that is consistent with the claim or refutes it
3. Describing your own reaction to the claim
