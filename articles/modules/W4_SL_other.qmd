### Writing Option 3: Stanford-Binet IQ test (6 points)

For this assignment, you will take the *long* version of the [Stanford-Binet IQ test](https://stanfordbinettest.com/) and then reflect on your experience of taking the test and whether or not it reflects aspects of "intelligence". 

1. Take the long/full version (24 minutes) of the test and record your score.
2. You do not need to report your score in the assignment, but reflect on how you felt about:

  - Taking the test: Were the questions easy or difficult?
  - The final score: Did it reflect your test-taking experience?
  - The "intelligence" aspect: Did you feel as though your intelligence was being tested? Which aspects of intelligence were highlighted vs. underemphasized in the assessment?
  
3. Finally, reflect on how someone who does not come from the same background as you may perform on this test. Do you think this test could be useful or harmful in different situations?

Your response should be at least 250 words and use full sentences (feel free to write more if you want). Submit your writing to this assignment posted on Canvas.
