**About me**: I am a cognitive scientist who is fascinated by how humans think, learn, and communicate. My [work](https://thelexiconlab.github.io/research/) involves conducting psychological experiments to understand different aspects of human behavior such as how we learn the meaning of words, how we search for information, and how we cooperate with one another. When I am not working, I enjoy playing board games, learning new recipes, and playing tennis (badly)! <br>

## What is this course about?

Why are humans considered the most “intelligent” species on the planet? Where does artificial intelligence (AI) fall short in mimicking this intelligent behavior? This seminar course delves into several such fundamental questions about human cognition and how our species is similar to and different from other minds and machines. We will discuss classic and modern approaches to understanding the mind, critically analyze various examples of intelligent behavior (such as language, cooperation, creativity, free will, etc.), evaluate recent work in machine learning and AI, and also draw insights about intelligence from the exciting literature on comparative (animal) cognition. You will read empirical articles, listen to podcasts,  lead discussions, and also participate through spoken presentations and short writing assignments.

## Why take this course? a.k.a. learning goals

The last few years have seen impressive highs and lows in the study and pursuit of intelligence. Through this course, I hope to communicate some of the excitement and skepticism that researchers in the field feel today. At the end of this course, you will be able to: <br>

1. Analyze and <span style="color:#508AB0">evaluate</span> current approaches to understanding and building intelligence
2.  <span style="color:#E7AC10">Synthesize</span> literature on a focused aspect of intelligence and produce an original critique
3. Develop an <span style="color:#1CB447">appreciation</span> for cultural and ethical issues surrounding the study of intelligence

## How will we communicate? 
The majority of our communication will occur via Canvas. Assignments will be posted and submitted on Canvas and questions about the course or the content can also be posted on Canvas. I and other classmates will respond to questions on Canvas so everyone has access to the questions and responses. Email will also be used regularly as part of this course. As much as possible, I will respond within 24 hours to emails with the exception that anything sent after 5pm on Fridays will not be addressed until Monday morning at the earliest. To meet with me individually, contact me via email.
